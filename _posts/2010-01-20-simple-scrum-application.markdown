 So, I have now finally a 'releasable' version of Simple Scrum.

Simple Scrum is an application that I have developed for myself to help me manage personal software projects using a Scrum-like workflow. It contains products management, stories, sprints and burn-down charts.

I have learned a lot more about Ruby, Ruby on Rails, code quality and tests on the development process, and I think those are the best results I have obtained for now.

The application is released under the MIT open source license.

I hope it can help others (if not as an usable application, at least as a learning material!).

I have also deployed a
[demo](http://simple-scrum-demo.heroku.com) version on
[Heroku](http://heroku.com/) (Heroku is so cool!). You can access it to have a sample view of the application.

The
[source code](http://github.com/fabiokr/simple-scrum) is hosted on
[Github](http://github.com).

There is a README file on the source code with install instructions.

Until next time!
