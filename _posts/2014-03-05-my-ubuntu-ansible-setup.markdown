In my [previous post](/blog/2013/12/03/manage-a-development-machine-with-ansible/) I talked about on how to manage an Ubuntu development machine with [Ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com). For reference, this is the full playbook I'm currently using for myself: [https://github.com/fabiokr/ansible-ubuntu](https://github.com/fabiokr/ansible-ubuntu). I'm releasing it under the MIT license, so please feel free to modify it to your own needs.
