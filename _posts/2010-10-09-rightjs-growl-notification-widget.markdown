Hi there!

I'm experimenting with
[RightJS](http://rightjs.org/) on some personal projects, and I'm starting to like it!

I have also developed my first Widget, a Growl like notification. It is based on
[Jquery-purr](http://code.google.com/p/jquery-purr/) plugin, and I have ported it to RightJS. It's freely available on
[Github](http://github.com/fabiokr/rightjs-growl).

I must do some tests on IE, but for now it's functional on Firefox and Chrome (the ones I have tested).

Until next time!
