[Sublime Related Files](https://github.com/fabiokr/sublime-related-files) is a [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/) plugin that displays a list of related files for your currently opened file.

For example, a source code file could be related to its unit test file.

It comes precofigured for a [Rails project](https://github.com/fabiokr/sublime-related-files/blob/master/RelatedFiles.sublime-settings), so it will display related test/spec files, views, controllers, helpers and routes, and you can easily add your own setup.

You can easily install it through the [Sublime Package Manager](https://sublime.wbond.net/).
